# Leetcode

This repository contains my solutions to various Leetcode problems implemented in C++. 
Each solution is provided with detailed explanations and step-by-step reasoning, 
along with the time and space complexities for better understanding.

This repository serves as a collection of my Leetcode solutions written in C++. 
The problems span across a wide variety of topics and difficulty levels, from simple to advanced problems. 
The solutions are designed with efficiency in mind and follow best practices to ensure clear, readable, and optimized code.

The main goal of this repository is to:
```
  Track and share my progress in solving algorithm and data structure problems on Leetcode.
  Provide well-documented, optimized solutions for various coding challenges.
  Help others learn from my problem-solving approaches in C++.
```

**Prerequisites**

To use this repository, you need to have the following tools installed:
  ~ C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
  ~ Leetcode (if you want to view the problems and test solutions)
  -> You can also install CMake for easier project management and building if necessary, 
     although it is not strictly required for individual problem files.
